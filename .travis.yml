# This is a bit of a hack:
# We want to ensure that we test the installed version, not the local source.
# For that reason we rename the local source directory before running the
# tests.
# Unfortunately this compilcates using coverage. We use '--parallel' and
# 'combine' to massage it into producing correct paths. For that to work
# we need to re-rename the source back to it's correct name.
